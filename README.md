# Ideas

* On a node on the mesh, simply dump babeld routes to get IPs of all active nodes.
* Get list of nodes and their addresses from `secrets` server.
* Use same ubus-http info as our frontend (maybe with a limited user account) to poll connection info from each node

This is enough to build node map with connections. In fact the first two points is enough for everything but drawing the connections.

# Notes

leafletjs with openstreetmaps and the built-in polylines feature for connections and the markercluser plugin for clustering.
